# CoVDeL

CoVDeL is a C++ library that provides implementations of classical computer vision and common image
processing algorithms, along with support for neural networks and deep learning variants. No major
third party libraries are used for the above implementations. C++17 standard is used in the project.
As far as possible, everything has been implemented from scratch.

## Modules

The library has the following hierarchy of modules and the classes defined within -

1. **Multiarray** [ `array` ]
2. **Computer Vision** [ `cv` ]
    * **Image**
3. **Deep Learning** [ `nn` ]
    * **Tensor**
    * **Module**
